## 👩‍💻 About me

I am currently an undergraduate student at the University of Information Technology (UIT), VNU-HCM.

Before focusing on Artificial Intelligence, I explored several projects in web development and data-related applications. Through this process, I gradually realized that I was more intellectually engaged by problems involving data, modeling, and decision-making, rather than purely system implementation.

This growing interest led me to Artificial Intelligence, where I found strong motivation in understanding how models learn, generalize, and adapt to complex real-world environments. Along the way, I also gained industry exposure through an internship experience.

However, I made a deliberate decision to pause my industry track in order to pursue in-depth AI research at my faculty laboratory. At this stage, my goal is to develop strong research capabilities in Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning before entering the labor market as an AI R&D engineer.
