## 👩‍💻 About me

I am currently an undergraduate student at the University of Information Technology (UIT), VNU-HCM.

Before focusing on Artificial Intelligence, I explored several projects in web development and data-related applications, which helped me build a solid technical foundation and practical mindset. I also gained industry exposure through an internship experience.

However, I made a deliberate decision to pause my industry track in order to pursue in-depth AI research at my faculty laboratory. At this stage, my goal is to develop strong research capabilities in Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning before entering the labor market as an AI R&D engineer.
